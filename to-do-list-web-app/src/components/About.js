              Unlike other to-do list websites, Inkigai was brought up out of
              weariness. It started here, immersed with innumerable tasks &
              longing for something more. Something that ignited a meaning,
              which sparked the very reason why we awoke each day. So, it went
              on an effort to locate the Ikigai, that sweet spot wherein desire
              combines a reason, ability meets life path.
